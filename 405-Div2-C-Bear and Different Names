/// it is just simple problem. First you have to make string array sothat you can store different type of array string.
/// next time you have to cheak all the string . If the string is "YES" then you have to print array string directly as
/// it contains different type of array other wise you have to print the first index where the second string was started

/// example    if n=5 and k=3 the strings is YES,NO,YES
5 3
A B YES
C NO
B YES
E
/// firstly for yes it print the array directly next for no it print the first index from where the second string started and next for yes
/// it again print the array directly


/// here the code below

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
string s[1000],s1;

int main()
{
    int i,n,k;
    for(i=0; i<=50; i++)
    {
        s[i]+=('A'+(i%26));
        if(i>=26)
            s[i]+=('a'+(i%26));
        
    }
    cin>>n>>k;
    for(i=0; i<k-1; i++)
    {
        cout<<s[i]<<" ";
    }
    for(i=k-1; i<n; i++)
    {
        cin>>s1;
        if(s1 == "YES")
            cout<<s[i]<<" ";
        else s[i]=s[i-k+1],cout<<s[i-k+1]<<" ";

    }
}
